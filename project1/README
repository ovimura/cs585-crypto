Submission Details:
The PSU-CRYPT program is a block-encryption algorithm which uses 64 bit block size and 80 bit key.
The algorithm is a combination of the Twofish and Skipjack. The first step in the encryption function
is the whitening between plaintext and the key. Next, there are 20 rounds in which it computes F(R0, R1, round),
then in the last round it undone the last swap. Lastly, the output is a result of the whitening the result of
the rounds with the key. The decryption function performs the same operations except the rounds' keys
are in reverse order. The key scheduler generates different subkeys on each round by left circular
rotation of 1 bit and then store the new key to be used to encrypt.

Steps to run the program:
- unzip the compressed file
- Navigate to the root directory
- Run the following command: $> python3 PSU-CRYPT.py -ed plaintext.txt key.txt ciphertext.txt
    - the encrypted data is stored in ciphertext.txt file
    - the decrypted data from ciphertext file is stored in decrypted_ciphertext.txt file
    -ed argument in the command line will encrypt the plaintext.txt data and store it to ciphertext.txt file
    -e argument, will encrypt the data from plaintext.txt file and store it to ciphertext.txt file
    -d argument, will decrypt data from ciphertext file and store it to decrypted_ciphertext.txt file

Submitting your solution
Turn in electronically:
All of your source code, documentation, etc. archived in a single compressed file. The compressed file name much include your last name. When you send in your code include the course number / project name in the subject line. 
Also include a text file named README that includes 
1.Your name and an email address you can be contacted at.
2.A brief description of what you are submitting.
3.A precise description of how to build and use your program on the PSU system
4.A list of files that should be in the archive, and a one line description of each file. 
Make sure you thoroughly test your code. This project is due before class on the due date. 
Submit this Project to me at bcsm@pdx.edu Demoing your solution, I will schedule short lab secessions for each of you to demo your code
