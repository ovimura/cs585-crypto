This is the submission of Project 2. This is a program for public-key cryptosystem which encrypts and decrypts a file
of any length. The cipher is based on modulo exponentiations all input and output files can contain integers.
The program after gets an random integer from user generates the public key and the private key and store it in the
corresponding files. User can choose from three options what to do, 1 - to setup, 2 - to encrypt the plaintext stored
in ptext.txt file, and 3 - decrypt the ciphertext stored ctext.txt file.


Run the following command to execute the program:
    python3 public_key.py

    Choose 1, 2, or 3
        1 - to run key generator (enter a random integer - the seed)
        2 - to run encryption (assuming the key generator run before least once)
        3 - to run decryption (assuming the key generator and encryption run before least once)



The files that are included:

    ctext.txt               ciphertext file
    dtext.txt               decrypted ciphertext from ctext.txt file
    ptext.txt               the plaintext file
    prikey.txt              the private key file
    pubkey.txt              the public key file
    public_key.py           the implementation of the public key cryptosystem
    README                  an overview of the functionality and content of the Project 2
    output_option_1.txt     the command line output of option 1
    output_option_2.txt     the command line output of option 2
    output_option_3.txt     the command line output of option 3
